# Story:
In the heart of the city, I found peace in a community garden. One day, while volunteering there, I heard organizers struggling with event planning. Inspired by their dedication, I saw an opportunity to merge my tech skills with community building. That’s why I started EventGenius — to simplify event planning and nurture connections like those in the garden.
